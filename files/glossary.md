    Kubernetes(K8s) is a container management PaaS(Platform as a Service). K8s uses what's called clusters which are
    made up of virtual machines (VMs) that each do specific tasks as either a master or a node. These nodes is a host
    for one or more containers. These containers contain applications and the master VM communicates with the nodes on
    whether to create or destroy nodes or to reroute traffic between nodes. 

    The reason to use Kubernetes is because it's faster than other methods, cheaper than other methods, 
    and much more efficient than other methods. Kubernetes offers virtually infinite scalability and access anywhere
    as either an on-premise, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure. The downside to K8s is that is requires other
    projects to function at full efficiency. In order to take advantage of everything Kubernetes has to offer it needs:
    Registry
    Networking
    Telemetry
    Security
    Automation
    and other services dependant on the task at hand.
