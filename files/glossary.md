## Front end Developer
A front end developer works on "front end" code in an application, commonly meaning the code that customers and product users interact with directly. A "front end dev" will typically write CSS, HTML and JavaScript in order to build complex interfaces for people to use. The front end development stack is always changing but tends to involve a front end library like Angular, React, Vue or Web components and a lot of backend knowledge in "tooling" like yarn / npm.

## IDE
IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. This software is used to debug, compile, and run the code. It is a software that can build applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface. IDE’s can support one or multiple languages of code. IDLE is an IDE that only supports python code. Visual studios, once downloaded the correct language, can support multiple languages.

## Vue.js

Vue.js (pronounced the same as ‘view’) is a progressive Javascript framework used for developing user interfaces. Designed to be adoptable, Vue's basics are relatively easy to understand and can easily be integrated into existing projects and libraries. Vue enables developers to extend HTML and HTML attributes with directives, special tokens in markup that indicate how the library should handle certain Document Object Model (DOM) elements. Directives can be built-in or user defined.

Vue is similar to React in purpose, but each have different pros and cons. Ease of integration is a common praise for Vue and a less strict learning curve is also a relevant bonus. Vue was created by one man named Evan You and has always been open-source, relying heavily on community support. He created Vue to combine features from already popular frameworks like React and Angular.
